---->To run the the fully connected model, convolutional model, or deep convolutional model, run test.py and
make sure that 'main_cnn.main()' is uncommented. You can also run it by running the 'main_cnn.py' directly. 
The fully connected model will be ran by default. In order to run the convolutional models, go to line 273 of
'main_cnn.py' and comment 'model = FCModel()' and uncomment the desired model.

---->To run the the auxiliary model, run test.py, comment 'main_cnn.main()', and uncomment 'main_auxiliary.main()'. 
You can also run it directly by running the 'main_auxiliary.py' . 

---->To run the the siamese model, run test.py, uncomment 'main_siamese.main()' and make sure that the other
call functions are commented. You can also run it directly by running the 'main_siamese.py'.
