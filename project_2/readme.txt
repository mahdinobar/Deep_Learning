Project 2: Mini  Deep Learning Framework
By Clementine Lea Aguet, Yamin Sepehri, and Mahdi Nobar

---->To run our deep learning framework that has been made without any use of PyTorch built-in nn frameworks,
open the 'test.py' file, make sure that 'main_new_framework.main()'is uncommented and run it. You can also run
it directly by 'main_new_framework.py'

---->To run the deep learning model based on the PyTorch NN framework that is made just for the comparison of 
results, open the 'test.py' file, comment 'main_new_framework.main()' and uncomment 'main_pytorch.main()'.
 You can also run it directly by running the 'main_pytorch.py' file.
